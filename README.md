## Requirements

Create a two page React app that fulfills the requirements of the short brief above:

1. List of Albums
2. Album Detail View

Use the JSON Placeholder API to fetch the data needed. You will need to use at least these two datasets:

Photo albums = [/albums](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums)

Photos = [/photos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos)

Fetch data as needed.
